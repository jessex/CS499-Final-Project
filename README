This is my final project for CS 499 - Nature Inspired Computation, and the final
project of my undergraduate education. It is an attempt to develop a Genetic 
Algorithm which can take in a list of individuals' schedules, of length n, and a 
number, k, which is the desired group size, and partition the individuals into 
n/k groups, matched up to have optimally matching schedules. It was inspired by 
a TA task that I was given where I had to partition students into project groups 
in such a way that students would be put into the best possible groups based on 
their schedules of availability.

Normally, I would not place a class project online like this, for a number of 
reasons. But, CS 499 is a "special topics" course so the specific "Nature 
Inspired Computation" class is unlikely to be repeated in this particular form 
and thus there is no fear of this work being used to assist any students in 
cheating. Additionally, this class is styled as an unofficial capstone course, 
and so on some level this is a capstone project for me. And, I was unable to 
find any application for Genetic Algorithms quite like this one, so I do believe
it has a degree of novelty (though GAs have been applied to other brands of 
partition problems with success).

The documentation, including the final paper and a presentation, can be found in
the 'docs/' directory. The source code for a standalone implementation of the 
Genetic Algorithm and the source code for a miniature test suite which compares 
the GA against three competing algorithms on a set of test problems can be found
in the 'src/' directory.

It's been fun. Yay, college!
